Hello, I'm MegzMugz, I'm a researcher and software engineer currently interested in between the intersection of compilers and system reliability. 

My personal and professional portfolio spans enterprise web applications using Ruby on Rails, and more recently C++ and GPU programming related work. Check out my pinned repos to see the work I'm most proud of.
